We started MapBox to make it easy for anyone to design and publish a beautiful custom map. Our platform gives developers the power to make maps that embody their product and brand. MapBox helps you find bars on foursquare, search for hotels on Hipmunk, and organize notes in Evernote. With our global, autoscaling infrastructure and cross-device compatibility, integrating our maps into your apps is easy even if you have millions of users. Over the last 3 years our team of dedicated cartographers, data analysts, and software engineers has built our entire stack using open source software and open data.', 'MapBox is an open source platform for designing and publishing maps and geo data for both mobile and on the web.', 'At MapBox we believe the future is open.

The objective is to help improve the pace of scientific research by improving the efficiency by which researchers can search for, compare and order scientific services on an open marketplace platform.For service providers, Science Exchange aims to increase utilization and quality recognition within an open marketplace.

Science Exchange helps researchers find the facility\'s services in a centralized platform, and increase utilization of labs that are running below capacity. The platform also allows for tracking of all work performed, and publications resulting from work performed on the site with collaborates - making management and reporting of service labs easier.Overall, the goal of Science Exchange is to help scientists access the resources and expertise at university based institutions, that they otherwise could not find, afford, or access.', 'Science Exchange\'s goal is to make it easier for researchers to access the world\'s scientific expertise, advancing open science initiatives to change the pace of scientific research.', 'Primarily, Science Exchange tracks the number of research collaborations formed through utilization of the online marketplace.
